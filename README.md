## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

### I'm Gabriela, nice to meet you.

### *About myself...*

After deciding to start a career transition to a field that could match better my personality, I discovered the Data Analysis training program which guided me to pursue a Business Data Analytics career path which now I am totally amazed by. In fact,  I discovered that using technology to collect relevant information and develop a visualization with it in order to collaborate with companies' performance is one of the activities that I am greatly excited about.
Hence, the spark I was missing ignited during this program and now I feel ready to start gaining real-world experience.

Throughout my previous professional experiences, I've had the opportunity to develop great skills in communication, problem-solving, writing, customer service, office organization, time management, and collaborative work with my colleagues. Recently I also have developed abilities including data analysis, Tableau, SQL, Python, Pandas, Excel, data storytelling, and business analytics.

Currently, I'm seeking an opportunity to expand my skills and gain valuable real-world experience. I'm committed to developing a career path to expand my work experience.
